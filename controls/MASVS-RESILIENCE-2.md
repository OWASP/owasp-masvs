# MASVS-RESILIENCE-2

## Statement

The app implements anti-tampering mechanisms.

## Description

Apps run on a user-controlled device, and without proper protections it's relatively easy to run a modified version locally (e.g. to cheat in a game, or enable premium features without paying), or upload a backdoored version of it to third-party app stores. This control tries to ensure the integrity of the app's intended functionality by preventing tampering at runtime, as well as modifications to the original code and resources.
